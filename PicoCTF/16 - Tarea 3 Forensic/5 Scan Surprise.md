I've gotten bored of handing out flags as text. Wouldn't it be cool if they were an image instead? You can download the challenge files here:

    challenge.zip

The same files are accessible via SSH here: ssh -p 53834 ctf-player@atlas.picoctf.net Using the password 6dd28e9b. Accept the fingerprint with yes, and ls once connected to begin. Remember, in a shell, passwords are hidden!

Hints:
1.-QR codes are a way of encoding data. While they're most known for storing URLs, they can store other things too.
2.-Mobile phones have included native QR code scanners in their cameras since version 8 (Oreo) and iOS 11
3.-If you don't have access to a phone, you can also use zbar-tools to convert an image to text

### Soluci√≥n

```
se descarga y descomprime la carpeta y me fui metiendo a los directorios hasta dar con un QR
el cual en una pagina scanner me dio la flag:

picoCTF{p33k_@_b00_a81f0a35}
